Hi! I'm Xin. I work at Amazon on the **Foundational AI (Rufus)** team, building domain-specific LLM collaborators for personalized e-commerce workflows. My current focus is on **post-training RL** (GRPO, RLOO), **rubric-based evaluation**, and **multi-criteria optimization** for LLMs.

Before this, I spent 4.5 years at Amazon Lab126 working on **AI security** --- adversarial red-teaming for LLM systems, prompt injection defense, and DNN-based vulnerability detection. I also contributed to **CodeGuru** for automated bug fixing.

I got my PhD from the University of Miami, where I worked on **optimization theory** (ADMM, proximal gradient, structured sparsity) for computational biology. I maintain two open-source R packages: [fssemR](https://github.com/Ivis4ml/fssemR) and [ssemQr](https://github.com/Ivis4ml/ssemQr).
