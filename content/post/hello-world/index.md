Welcome to my personal site! I'll be writing about topics I work on and think about:

- **Post-training RL for LLMs** --- rubric-reward methods, multi-criteria optimization, reward hacking
- **Evaluation** --- Agent-as-Judge, automated rubric generation, benchmark design
- **AI security** --- adversarial red-teaming, prompt injection, vulnerability detection

Stay tuned.
